# check_ids
Assume that two tsv files contain tabulated data, with two identifiers columns: "cid" and "asin". You are interested in obtaining how many pairs of values ("cid", "asin") are only in one of the two files, as well as how many values of "cid" are only in one of the two files, and the same for "asin".
The code uses sets and the symmetric difference of sets.
